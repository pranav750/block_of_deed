Live Demo :- https://block-of-deed.netlify.app

<strong>Warning - This web application will be sending transactions. That means MetaMask is mandatory for this web application.</strong>

I'm listing all the functionalities of the web application below for those who don't have Metamask installed on their browser.

<strong>Home Page -</strong>

  - This is the home page. As you can see, Metamask will ask you to unlock your account so that it can connect to the web application.
  - Put the password and connect to the web application.

<strong>Register -</strong>

  - This is a prototype. That's why to register, you only need to put your name. For future improvements, we can add further more fields here as required.
  - The web application will create an instance of admin and provide you the address of the admin which will later be used in logging in.

<strong>Add Property -</strong>

  - Use the address of the person and fill the informations in the form to add properties under their name.
  - This is a prototype. That's why I didn't know what other informations is required to put the property under a person's name. 
  - That is the reason I've used this form inputs.
